### About Me

I am a second year PhD student at the University of Washington systems lab. I work with [Tom Anderson](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/tom) on a Quality-of-Service aware filesystem for cloud applications. I am broadly interested in operating systems and distributed systems, and more specifically in end to end performance guarantees for cloud services. I did my undergrad at University of Texas at Austin working with [Simon Peter](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~simon/). 

I also enjoy photography, musical, traveling, random walks, and finding good food :)

### Projects
I have been working on a new [teaching operating system](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/osv-public) with another [Jialin](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~lijl). We focus on creating a clean interface between machine dependent and machine independent code in the OS to help students understand subsystems functionality and low level details indepdently. We are also working on more testing features including data race detector and model checker.
